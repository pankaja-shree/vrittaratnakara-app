      Samskriti Foundation, Mysore is a Public Trust engaged in the activity of preservation and propagation of Cultural and Scientific Heritage of India. Over the last ten years of its existence, it has brought out several publications in the form of books, Audio CDs and Interactive Multimedia Computer CDs on various aspects of Indian cultural heritage, Manuscriptology and so on. Even as the world is seeing uncontrolled deterioration in all spheres of human life, the Foundation has embarked on a journey to once again re-establish the moral and spiritual values in the world, by its innovative and pioneering programmes that are aimed at enabling the world at large to live a life in harmony with nature and uphold the path of righteousness.
Samskriti is an earnest endeavor to improve the quality of life as the quality of life is at its best only when man learns to live with nature in harmony.
